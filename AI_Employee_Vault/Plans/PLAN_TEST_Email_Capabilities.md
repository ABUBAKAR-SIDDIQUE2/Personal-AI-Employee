# Plan: Email Capabilities Assessment and Enablement

## Objective

**Goal:** Assess current email capabilities and create a roadmap to enable email sending through MCP servers.

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Document current tool inventory
- [x] Identify missing email capabilities
- [ ] Provide configuration instructions for email MCP
- [ ] Create actionable next steps for user

## Context

### Input Summary
Test file requests verification of email sending capabilities through MCP servers. The AI Employee needs "Hands" (Action layer) to send emails autonomously as part of the architecture.

### Key Information
- **Source:** Test file in /Needs_Action
- **Urgency:** Medium - blocking autonomous email operations
- **Stakeholders:** User building AI Employee system
- **Keywords/Flags:** MCP, email, capabilities, test

### Constraints
- No email MCP server currently configured
- Email MCP server doesn't exist in public registry
- Must use placeholders for credentials (security)

## Reasoning (ReAct Pattern)

### Thought 1: Initial Assessment
I have access to file system tools, bash commands, and various utilities, but NO email-specific MCP tools. The hackathon documentation references an "email-mcp" server, but my research shows it doesn't exist in the public MCP registry yet.

### Thought 2: Risk Analysis
Without email MCP, the AI Employee cannot autonomously send emails. This is a critical gap in the "Hands" layer. However, we have Gmail API already set up for the watcher - we could potentially use that as a workaround.

### Thought 3: Strategy Selection
Best approach: Document current state, provide MCP configuration template based on hackathon docs, and suggest alternative solutions (Gmail API wrapper, custom MCP server, or wait for official release).

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Assessment
- [x] Check available tools for email capabilities
  - **Tool/Resource:** Internal tool inventory
  - **Expected Outcome:** Confirmed no email MCP tools available
- [x] Research email MCP server availability
  - **Tool/Resource:** Context7, Web search, MCP registry
  - **Expected Outcome:** Confirmed email-mcp doesn't exist publicly

### Phase 2: Documentation
- [ ] Create capability assessment report
  - **Tool/Resource:** Write tool
  - **Expected Outcome:** Clear documentation of what's available vs. needed
- [ ] Provide MCP configuration template
  - **Tool/Resource:** Based on hackathon documentation
  - **Expected Outcome:** User can configure when email-mcp becomes available

### Phase 3: Alternative Solutions
- [ ] Document Gmail API workaround option
  - **Tool/Resource:** Existing gmail_watcher.py code
  - **Expected Outcome:** Interim solution for email sending
- [ ] Suggest custom MCP server development
  - **Tool/Resource:** MCP SDK documentation
  - **Expected Outcome:** Path to building custom email server

## Required Resources

### Tools & MCPs
- [x] **File System** - For reading/writing files
- [x] **Bash** - For system commands
- [ ] **Email MCP** - NOT AVAILABLE (this is the gap)
- [x] **Gmail API** - Available via Python (workaround)

### Information Needed
- [x] MCP configuration file location
- [x] Email MCP server package name (doesn't exist yet)
- [ ] User's preference: wait for official MCP or build custom?

### Approvals Required
- [ ] User decision on approach (wait vs. build custom vs. use Gmail API)

## Contingency Plans

### If Email MCP Never Releases
**Fallback:** Build custom MCP server using Gmail API
**Escalation:** Provide development guide for custom server

### If User Needs Email Now
**Action:** Implement Python script using existing Gmail API
**Blocker:** Won't integrate with Claude Code MCP architecture

## Execution Log

### 2026-02-16 17:32:00 - Plan Created
- Status: Draft
- Next Action: Execute Phase 2 (Documentation)
