# Test: Email Capabilities Check

## Objective

Verify that the AI Employee (Digital FTE) has access to email sending capabilities through MCP servers.

## Instructions

Please check your available tools and answer the following:

1. **Do you see a tool capable of sending emails?**
   - List any email-related tools available
   - Note the tool names and their capabilities

2. **If email tools are available:**
   - Draft a test email to `myself@example.com`
   - Subject: "AI Employee Email Test"
   - Body: "This is a test email from the AI Employee system. If you receive this, email capabilities are working correctly."
   - **DO NOT SEND** - Save the draft to `/Plans/DRAFT_Test_Email.md`

3. **If email tools are NOT available:**
   - Document what's missing
   - Suggest next steps to enable email capabilities
   - Create a plan in `/Plans/PLAN_Enable_Email_Capabilities.md`

## Expected Outcome

A clear report on email capabilities and either:
- A draft email saved to `/Plans/DRAFT_Test_Email.md`, OR
- A plan to enable email capabilities in `/Plans/PLAN_Enable_Email_Capabilities.md`

## Notes

This test is part of implementing the "Hands" (Action) layer of the AI Employee architecture. Email sending is critical for autonomous operation.
